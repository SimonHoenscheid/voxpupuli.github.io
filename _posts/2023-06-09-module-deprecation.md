As a result of a set of discussions on IRC and on the mailinglist. We will archive the
following modules due to lack of community engagement:

* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-system
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_autoupdate
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_eventlog
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_power
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_env
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-sslcertificate
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-msoffice

The modules will stay available on Github and on the Forge. They will be marked
as deprecated on the forge. We can unarchive the repos any time in case someone
steps up and wants to keep maintaining them.
