As of today, we've officially joined dev.to, a leading platform for tech and development blogging. In addition to our established blog on voxpupuli.org, we'll be expanding our reach to include dev.to. Stay tuned for upcoming posts, including insights into the Project Management Committee (PMC) election and the significance of being part of the PMC. These initial posts mark the beginning of our journey on both platforms, and we're excited to see where it takes us.
