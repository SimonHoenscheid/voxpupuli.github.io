After a slight delay, we are opening the voting period for this year's PMC elections.
Votes will be accepted until **May 15 2024 23:59 UTC.**

Please help us select the Vox Pupuli Project Management Committee for the 2024 year.
The people on this committee will help take care of the Code of Conduct and its
values, participate in strategic planning, and decision making using lazy consensus,
amongst other things.

New this year, we are also adding two specialized roles:

- The accounting officer will keep track of budget, expenses, and sponsorships.
- The social media officer will coordinate social, blog, and other similar activities.
  They're not necessarily responsible for -all- content, but will help facilitate it.

These roles will be self selected amongst the committee after the election concludes.

Visit the page below to read more about the candidates and to make your choices.
