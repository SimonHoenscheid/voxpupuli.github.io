This is our new blog series, where we inform you about changes within Vox Pupuli
itself or our codebase! Today we start with the first one, information about
dropping Puppet Ruby < 2.7 support in our gems!

For historic reasons our gems support a wide (and different) set of Ruby
versions. Now that Puppet 6 is EoL (which shipped Ruby 2.5), we don't require
Ruby 2.5 anymore in our Pipeline. And implementing Ruby 3.2 in some gems
requires to drop Ruby 2.4 in some gems. We decided to make a hard cut and drop
everything below Ruby 2.7. That version is not yet EoL and used in Puppet 7.

One exception are gems that are used in Puppetserver jruby, for example
hiera-eyaml. Puppetserver 7 JRuby is compatible with Ruby 2.6, so those gems
will keep maintaing support for this legacy Ruby version.

We created a new gem, [voxpupuli-rubocop](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli-rubocop).
It provides us:

* A [RuboCop configuration](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli-rubocop/blob/master/rubocop.yml)
* A [rake task](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli-rubocop/blob/master/lib/voxpupuli/rubocop/rake.rb) to run RuboCop
* And pulls in [all required dependencies](https://github.com/voxpupuli/voxpupuli-rubocop/blob/235d03f09719f9ad570ae5c045383983b6dfe57e/voxpupuli-rubocop.gemspec#L17-L21)

We also have a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/voxpupuli/projects/4/views/1)
to track the progress.
