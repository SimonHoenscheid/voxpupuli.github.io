Puppet stepped up and is interested in maintaining some of our (archived)
windows modules. Today we migrated the following git repositories to them:

* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_env
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-sslcertificate
* https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_eventlog

You can see all our archived repos at: https://github.com/orgs/voxpupuli/repositories?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=

Let us know if you're interesting in maintaining any of those projects.
