Puppet stepped up and is interested in maintaining some of our (archived)
windows modules. Today we migrated the following git repositories to them:

* [github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_env](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_env)
* [github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-sslcertificate](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-sslcertificate)
* [github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_eventlog](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windows_eventlog)

You can see all our archived repos at: [github.com/orgs/voxpupuli/repositories?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=](https://github.com/orgs/voxpupuli/repositories?q=&type=archived&language=&sort=)

Let us know if you're interesting in maintaining any of those projects.
