As announced at CfgMgmtCamp last week, we are kicking off the more-or-less annual
PMC elections process. This is a yearly process to provide more people opportunities
to get involved with our leadership and decision making.  Would you like to help set
roadmap or help architect our Puppet 8 support plans? Do you want to help organize
events or run social media? Do you love spreadsheets and want to help with accounting
and fundraising? Maybe you'd like to help curate our blog or source content from
fresh writers.

Maybe you just want to get involved and help out with whatever is needed. Joining the
PMC is your avenue to this involvement.

Starting today, you may nominate yourself or someone else for the elections. Nominations
are open until *March 22 2024 23:59 UTC* and then we'll vote to select the 5 new members
of the PMC.

See the [elections page in our plumbing repository](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/elections/2024-01.md)
for nomination instructions.

I'll be your elections officer this year. I hope to see your PR soon, and I've got a
Vox hoodie for the first person to submit a nomination.

Thanks!
