Due to high demand in the community, we forked
[jsok/vault](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/jsok/vault/readme)
to [Vox Pupuli](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/vault/readme). We did the
first release today.

Vox Pupuli now maintains all major modules for HashiCorp:

* [hashi_stack](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/hashi_stack/readme)
* [vault](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/vault/readme)
* [consul](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/consul/readme)
* [nomad](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/nomad/readme)
