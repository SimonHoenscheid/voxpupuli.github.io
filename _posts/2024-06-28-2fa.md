[In 2023](https://groups.io/g/voxpupuli/message/476) we announced that we (or
rather GitHub themself) want to enforce two factor authentication for our
organisation. We now want to enforce that at 2024-07-05. We currently only have
4 people in our org without 2FA enabled, so the potential impact is quite low.
