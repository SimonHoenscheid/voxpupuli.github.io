title: Single Server
date: 2023-08-06
version: v0.0.2
summary: A simple server/agent architecture with all services running on a single machine.
---

## Intended Audience

This architecture is intended for small to medium static infrastructures and is
easier to set up and maintain than a load balanced compiler farm. Generally speaking,
redundancy and HA are most useful for dynamic environments. A stopped Puppet
server doesn't prevent the existing configuration from being enforced but it will
halt any new deployments or configuration updates. If those constraints fit your
needs, then this architecture is suggested.

## Setup and Usage

{write a guide on how to deploy, configure, and use this architecture}


### Git Repository

We recommend organizing your code as a Control Repository with branches for
environments. See the [reference repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/control-repo)
for an example.


### Foreman

[Foreman](https://www.theforeman.org) is a complete lifecycle management tool
for physical and virtual servers. It will provide you with a graphical
classifier, a Hiera data source, and report monitoring. It also includes the
power to easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy applications, and
proactively manage servers, on-premise or in the cloud.


### Puppet Webhook

Configure [Puppet Webhook](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet_webhook) to receive
webhook events from your code repository and automate your code deploys.

### Code Deployment

[r10k](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k) is considered the default Puppet code
deployment tool. Install it on your server in your infrastructure and use it to
deploy your control repository as needed.

If you're a Golang shop, you might consider [g10k](https://github.com/xorpaul/g10k) as well.


### Puppet Stack

We recommend managing each of these components with the supported module.

* PuppetDB
    * [puppetlabs/puppetdb](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)
    * The default PostgreSQL database is recommended.
* Puppet Server
    * [theforeman/puppet](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/theforeman/puppet)
* Puppet Agents
    * [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent)
* Puppet Metrics Dashboard
    * [puppetlabs/puppet_metrics_dashboard](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_metrics_dashboard)
* Hiera Data Manager (HDM)
    * [puppet/hdm](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/hdm)
